# Guide for dbg

## Compile without debugging

To completely prevent any debugging code compiled into a binary (including test binary), add a build tag as:

```sh
go build -tags=nodebug <...>

# or

go test -tags=nodebug <...>
```

This can be useful to keep debugging code committed but not called in production environment.

## Dynamic on/off

At the same time, any debugging code can be completely switched off using `dbg.Enable(false)` call.

As you can guess this can be enabled back by `dbg.Enable(true)` (which is the default).

NOTE: compiled with `-tags=nodebug` will make `dbg.Enable(...)` no-op.

## Watch how long function takes

For that we have `dbg.Watch` function. In most cases it will be used in defer statement like:

```go
func Debug1() {
	defer dbg.Watch()() // NOTE: double () !!!
	// ... code to debug
}

func Debug1() {
	// ... preparation code

	watch := dbg.Watch()
	// ... code to debug
	watch()

	// ... some other code
}
```

## Collect how many times line was executed

Function `dbg.Hit` is a simple counter exactly for the line where it's called. Can be called from different goroutines. 

Use `dbg.PrintHits` to print the result of all hits.

```go
func Debug() {
	for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
		go func() {
			if i % 3 == 0 {
				dbg.Hit()
			}
		}()
	}

	dbg.PrintHits()
}
```

## Call function once on the line

During debugging quite often you might need to define `sync.Once` and use it once (obviously). But defining it every time might be cumbersome.

To make this simpler we have `dbg.Once`, see:

```go
var parallel = os.Getenv("PARALLEL") == "true"

func Debug() {
	if parallel {
		dbg.Once(func() { /* do something once */ })
		// ...
		return
	}
	// ...
}
```

And quite often the only thing you need once is to print something, `dbg.PrintOnce` does exactly that:

```go
var parallel = os.Getenv("PARALLEL") == "true"

func Debug() {
	if parallel {
		dbg.PrintOnce("yes, parallel is enabled")
		// ...
		return
	}
	// ...
}
```

## Rare or repeating actions

There are cases when you want to do an action but not very often, `dbg.Rarely` can call your function with a given probability:

```go
func StringLen(input string) int {
	// 0.1 which is approximately 10% of all StringLen calls.
	dbg.Rarely(0.1, func(count int64) {
		println("got input len:", len(input))
	})
	return len(input)
}
```

Similar function `dbg.Every` does the same but every X calls.

```go
func StringLen(input string) int {
	// every 12 StringLen calls do func.
	dbg.Every(12, func(count int64) {
		println("got input len:", len(input))
	})
	return len(input)
}
```

To do something with an interval function `dbg.Interval` does the thing:

```go
func GetFromCache(key int) {
	// two consecutive calls with 10sec+ difference.
	dbg.Interval(10*time.Second, func(last int64) {
		println("cache size:", len(cache))
	})
	
	...
}
```

## Sink value

During debug you might find yourself commenting/uncommenting a lot of code and each comment can impact variable usage.

Because Go doesn't forgive unused variables you are forced to write `_ = x` to make program compile.

To make this simpler use `dbg.Sink`:

```go
func Debug1() {
	x := 123
	y := 456

	// TODO: why it panics?
	// res := 1.0 / float64(y - 2*x)

	dbg.Sink(x, y)
}
```
